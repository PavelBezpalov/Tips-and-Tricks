## Jenkins Project Tokens

### BUILD_NUMBER
The current build number, such as "153"
### BUILD_ID
The current build ID, identical to BUILD_NUMBER for builds created in 1.597+, but a YYYY-MM-DD_hh-mm-ss timestamp for older builds
### BUILD_DISPLAY_NAME
The display name of the current build, which is something like "#153" by default.
### JOB_NAME
Name of the project of this build, such as "foo" or "foo/bar". (To strip off folder paths from a Bourne shell script, try: ${JOB_NAME##*/})
### BUILD_TAG
String of "jenkins-${JOB_NAME}-${BUILD_NUMBER}". Convenient to put into a resource file, a jar file, etc for easier identification.
### EXECUTOR_NUMBER
The unique number that identifies the current executor (among executors of the same machine) thatâ€™s carrying out this build. This is the number you see in the "build executor status", except that the number starts from 0, not 1.
### NODE_NAME
Name of the slave if the build is on a slave, or "master" if run on master
### NODE_LABELS
Whitespace-separated list of labels that the node is assigned.
### WORKSPACE
The absolute path of the directory assigned to the build as a workspace.
### JENKINS_HOME
The absolute path of the directory assigned on the master node for Jenkins to store data.
### JENKINS_URL
Full URL of Jenkins, like http://server:port/jenkins/ (note: only available if Jenkins URL set in system configuration)
### BUILD_URL
Full URL of this build, like http://server:port/jenkins/job/foo/15/ (Jenkins URL must be set)
### JOB_URL
Full URL of this job, like http://server:port/jenkins/job/foo/ (Jenkins URL must be set)
### SVN_REVISION
Subversion revision number that's currently checked out to the workspace, such as "12345"
### SVN_URL
Subversion URL that's currently checked out to the workspace.

## Extended E-Mail Tokens
Arguments may be given for each token in the form name="value" for strings and in the form name=value for booleans and numbers. In string arguments, escape ", \, and line terminators (\n or \r\n) with a \, e.g. arg1="\"quoted\""; arg2="c:\\path"; and arg3="one\ntwo". The brackets may be omitted if there are no arguments.

Examples: $TOKEN, ${TOKEN}, ${TOKEN, count=100}, ${ENV, var="PATH"}

### ${DEFAULT_SUBJECT}

This is the default email subject that is configured in Jenkinss system configuration page.

### ${DEFAULT_CONTENT}
This is the default email content that is configured in Jenkinss system configuration page.

### ${DEFAULT_PRESEND_SCRIPT}
This is the default pre-send script content that is configured in Jenkinss system configuration. This is the only token supported in the pre-send script entry field.
### ${PROJECT_DEFAULT_SUBJECT}
This is the default email subject for this project. The result of using this token in the advanced configuration is what is in the Default Subject field above. WARNING: Do not use this token in the Default Subject or Content fields. Doing this has an undefined result.
### ${PROJECT_DEFAULT_CONTENT}
This is the default email content for this project. The result of using this token in the advanced configuration is what is in the Default Content field above. WARNING: Do not use this token in the Default Subject or Content fields. Doing this has an undefined result.
